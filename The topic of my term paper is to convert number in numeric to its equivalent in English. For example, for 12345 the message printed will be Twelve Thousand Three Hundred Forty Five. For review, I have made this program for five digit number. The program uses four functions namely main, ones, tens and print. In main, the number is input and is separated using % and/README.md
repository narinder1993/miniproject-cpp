The topic of my term paper is to convert number in numeric to its equivalent in English. For example, for 12345 the message printed will be Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five. For review, I have made this program for five digit number.
The program uses four functions namely main, ones, tens and print. In main, the number is input and is separated using % and /. Then the suffix “thousand” and “hundred” are added to the numbers according to the conditions and the function print is called. In the function ones, the numbers from 1 to 19 are given their equivalent names in English using if condition. In the function tens, the numbers greater than 19 are schemed to be named and definition for numbers at tens place is given. For eg., if 6 is at tens place “sixty” is printed. In function print, the if condition checks if the number is between 1 to 19 or greater than 19 and prints the equivalent words accordingly. My final term paper will include conversion of seven digit numbers to their equivalent in English.
